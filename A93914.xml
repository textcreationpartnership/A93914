            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is preſented unto thee a ſhort Treatiſe of the Art of <hi>Dialling.</hi> Concerning the antiquity, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and neceſſity thereof, I ſhall in this place ſay little, the antiquity thereof being well known to all who have diligently read the Sacred Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made of that of King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> upon which the Almighty was pleaſed to expreſs a Miracle for the recovery of K. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by cauſing the Sun to go back ten deg. upon the ſaid Dial, and this is the firſt that was ever recorded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above 2400 years agoe, ſince which time, Learning ſpreading it ſelfe over the whole Univerſe, hath made this Art more common.</p>
            <p>For the excellencie of it, the skill which is required in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Geometry, Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Optiques,</hi> for the making a man compleat and excellent, is an evident proof, for without good knowledge in the Elements of <hi>Geometry,</hi> with a competencie of knowledge in the <hi>Circles</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> and ſome in-ſight in the <hi>Optiques,</hi> in vain doth a man beſtow his time in the ſtudy of this Art of <hi>Dialling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the neceſſity of it, what is more neceſſary in a well ordered <hi>Common-wealth?</hi> what action can be performed in due ſeaſon without it? or what man can appoint any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with another, and not prefix a time, without the loſſe of that which cannot be re-gained, and ought therefore to moſt be prized.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe that all the light which we receive is from the great and glorious light of the World, (the <hi>Sun</hi>) we have fetcht the beams thereof from Heaven, to enlighten the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men upon earth, and from whoſe Light we receive and retein the benefit of all our knowledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this Art of <hi>Dialling</hi> being in it ſelf ſo excellent and neceſſary, may induce any induſtrious perſon to the practiſe thereof, the perfect knowledge whereof in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe is ſufficiently taught, and that by ſuch briefe, eaſie, and familiar wayes, that not any Treatiſe hitherto publiſhed, can for convenience, eaſe, and quick diſpatch, be compared thereto.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:168528:4"/>
            <p>The whole Treatiſe conſiſteth of five Books, in which the whole myſtery of the Art of Dialling is plainly taught three ſeveral wayes, namely, two Geometrically, and the third Inſtrumentally.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I The firſt Book containeth certain Elements of <hi>Geometry</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> as alſo how to perform divers Propoſitions in <hi>Geometry.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II The Second ſheweth how to perform moſt Propoſitions in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Navigation,</hi> Geometrically, with Scale and Compaſſe only.</item>
               <item>III The Third ſheweth how to find the Inclination and Declination of any Plane without Inſtrument, as alſo how to draw the hour-lines upon any Plane howſoever, and in what Latitude ſoever ſcituate, by Rule and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe only, two ſeveral wayes, in both which, the two grand inconveniencies of the common wayes (<hi>viz.</hi> of our-running the limits of the Plane; and drawing of many un-neceſſary lines) are totally avoided, you having no lines to draw, but ſuch as will be compriſed within the bounds of your Plane and thoſe ſo few, that you need not fear confuſion.</item>
               <item>IV <hi>&amp;</hi> V The Fourth, and Fifth, ſheweth the conſtinction and uſe of a Quadrant, by which all the moſt uſual Propoſitions in <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> may be wrought with great facility, and by which the Inclination and Declination of a Plane may be ſpeedily attained, and alſo the hour-lines drawn upon all kind of Planes in any Latitude.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Unto theſe five Books is added an <hi>Appendix,</hi> ſhewing how to furniſh any kind of Dial with Aſtronomical variety, as to draw thereon the parallels of declination, by which the place of the Sun may be known: the parallel of the lenght of the day, by which the day of the Moneth, the Sun riſing and ſetting, the length of the day and night may be known: how many hours are paſt ſince Sun riſing, and how many remain to Sun ſetting: The old un-equal hours, by which the day is divided into twelve equal parts according to the Jewiſh account: The azimuths, by which you may know in what quarter of the heavens the Sun is at any time of the day: The Almicanters or Circles of altitude, by which the height of the Sun, the proportion of ſhadows to their bodies may be eaſily diſcovered. And laſtly, How to draw a Dial on the ſeeling of a Room by reflection: all which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Geometrically by Rule and Compaſſe only, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great delight and pleaſure in the practice of this moſt excellent Art. All which is here preſented to thee as freely as it was given from God, who is the Author and giver of all good things.</p>

                  <head>The manner how to divide the line of Chords.</head>
                  <p>Although the making or dividing of this line of Chords be well known unto all thoſe that do make Mathematical Inſtruments, yet I would not have them that ſhall make uſe of this Book: be ignorant of the dividing of this line: Therefore, firſt, draw the diameter A D C, which being done, upon the center D deſcribe the ſemicircle A B C, which ſemicircle divide into two equal parts or quadrants by the Point B, then dividing one of theſe quadrants into 90 equal parts, or degrees, you are prepared, as here you ſee in the quadrant A B.</p>
                  <p>Now this being done, ſet one foot of your Compaſſes in the point A, and let the other be extended unto each degree of the quadrant A B, and theſe extents transfer into the line ADC, as here you ſee is done. This line ſo divided into 90 unequal diviſions from the point A, (and numbred by 10, 20, 30, 40, &amp;c. unto 90) is called a line of Chords, and may be ſet on your Rule, as here you ſee is done. And this may be as well performed within the quadrant D A B, by transferring the degrees of the quadrant A B into the line A E B, or into any other line: and here you may ſee that when you open your compaſſes unto 60 degrees in the quadrant, and transfer it into the line A D, that it will light upon the center D, whereby it doth plainly appear that 60 of thoſe degrees are equal to the ſemidiameter of the ſame circle, and therefore is the Radius upon which all circles are drawn, as was ſhewed before in this Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> How to find out the latitude of a place, or the Poles elevation above the Horizon, by the Sun.</head>
               <p>SEeing that throughout this Book, the latitude of the place is ſuppoſed to be known, when as every one perhaps cannot tell which way to find it out, therefore it will not be un-needful to ſhew how it may be readily attained, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently for our purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:168528:32"/>
               <p>Firſt, therefore you muſt get the Meridian altitude, which you may doe by obſerving diligently about noon a little before, and a little after, ſtill obſerving until you perceive the Sun to begin to fall again, then marking what was his greateſt altitude, will ſerve for this our preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Having gotten the Meridian altitude by this, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination by the 7 chapter, you may find the latitude of the place, or the elevation of the Pole above the Horizon after this manner. If the Sun hath North Declination, then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Declination out of the Meridian altitude, and the remainder ſhall be the height of the Equinoctial. But if the Sun hath South Declination, then adde the Declination to the Meridian altitude, ſo ſhall the ſum of them give the alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Equinoctial, which being taken out of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant or 90 deg. leaveth the latitude of your place, or the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Pole above your Horizon.</p>
               <p>As for example upon the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> 1650, the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian altitude of the Sun being obſerved to be 55 deg. 35 m. upon which day I find the Suns place to be in 20 deg. 48 m. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and the declination 18 deg. 00 min. and becauſe the declination is North, I ſubſtract 18 deg. 00 min. out of the Meridian altitude 55 deg. 35 min. and there remains 37 deg. 35 min. the height of the Equinoctial, and this taken out of 90 deg. leaveth 52 deg. 25 m. for the latitude of <hi>Thuring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be required ſometimes for you to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for a Town or Countrey whoſe Latitude you know not, neither can come thither conveniently to obſerve it. Here is therefore added a Table ſhewing the latitude of the moſt principal Cities and Towns in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make a Dial for any of thoſe places, you need but look in your Table, and there you have the Latitude thereof. But if the Town you ſeek be not in the Table, look what Town in the Table lies neer unto it, and make your Dial to that Latitude, which will occaſion little difference.</p>

               <p>Firſt, take any board that hath one ſtraight ſide, and an inch or more from the ſtraight ſide draw a line parallel thereto, about the middle of which line erect a perpendicular line, and at the center where theſe two lines meet, cut out a hollow piece from the edge of the parallel line for a plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met to hang in: then if your plane ſeem to be level with the horizon, you may try it by applying the ſtraight ſide of your board thereunto, and holding the perpendicular line up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and holding a threed and plummet in your hand, ſo as the plummet may have free play in the hole; for then if the threed ſhall fall on the perpendicular line, which way ſoevreyou turn the board, it is an horizontal plane.</p>

               <p>FOr the diſtinguiſhing of Planes, becauſe their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and declination may be divers, we will conſider three lines belonging to every plane; the firſt is the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line, the ſecond the perpendicular line, croſſing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal at right angles, the third is the axis of the plane, croſſing both the horizontal line and his perpendicular, and the plane itſelf, at right angles; the extremity of which axis
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168528:34"/>may be called the pole of the Planes horizontall line.</p>
               <p>The perpendicular line doth help to find the inclination, the horizontal line with his Axis to finde the Declination, and the pole of the Planes horizontal line, to give denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the plane.</p>
               <p>When the plane ſtandeth upright, pointing directly into the Zenith, it maketh right angles with the Horizon, and is therefore called an erect Plane, and a plumb-line drawn thereon is called a Vertical line, as in this figure, the plane G H L I is erect, and the line H I is the vertical line.</p>
               <p>Now for the trying of this Plane, if you apply the ſtraight ſide of your board vertically thereto, as here you ſee done in the figure C, and either hanging a threed and plummet in the point M, or holding up a threed and plummet with your hand, you find the threed to fall directly on the parallel line M N, it is an erect plane, but if the threed will croſs the line M N, it is no erect plane, but inclineth to the Horizon.</p>
               <p>And if you finde your plane to be erect, you may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying your board thereto, with the threed and plummet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the parallel line M N, draw the vertical line H I by the edge of your board, the vertical line being drawn, you may croſſe it at right angles with the line G L, which ſhall be level with your Horizon, and therefore called the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line of the plane.</p>
               <p>If the plane ſhall be found to incline to the Horizon, you may find out the inclination after this manner,</p>
               <p>Apply your board to the plane, as you ſee here by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure B, in the plane F K E H, then holding up a threed and plummet, that it may fall upon the perpendicular line O E, and turning about your board, till the ſtraight ſide thereof lie cloſe with the plane, and the threed fall on the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular line O E, ſo the line drawn by the ſtraight ſide of the board, ſhall be an horizontal line, which here in this figure will be the line F E.</p>

               <p>Then by the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond Book draw the line S C, making the angle S C A equal to the latitude of the place, which here we will ſuppoſe to be 52 deg. 30 min. this line ſhall repreſent the cock of the Dial, and the Axle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the world; then at the North end of the Meridian line draw another line as F G, croſſing the Meridian in the point A at right angles, this line is called the Touch-line, or line of contingence. Then ſet one foot of your Compaſſes in the point A, and with the other take the necreſt extent unto the line S C or the ſtile, with this diſtance turning your compaſſes about, with one foot ſtill in the point A, with the other make a mark in the Meridian, as at I, which ſhall be the center of the Equinoctial, upon which deſcribe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial Circle A D B E, with this ſame diſtance ſetting one foot in the point A, make a mark at F on the one ſide of the Meridian, and another at G on the other ſide thereof, both which muſt be in the line of contingence, by which two points and the center C you may draw the hour-lines of 3 and 9.</p>

               <p>A Vertical plane is that which is parallel to the prime ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical circle, it hath two faces, one to the South, the other to the North; therefore having drawn the horizontal line A B, and from the middle thereof let fall the perpendicular C D, which if you find by the ſecond Chapter to be erect, and the Horizontal line A B to lie in the line of Eaſt &amp; weſt, and ſo to have no declination, you may be ſure this plane is parallel to the prime vertical circle of the Sphere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called a vertical plane.</p>
               <p>This perpendicular C D ſhall ſerve for the meridian, the hour of 12, and the ſubſtilar line, which is the line over which the Stile or Gnomon in your Dial directly hangeth.</p>

               <p>Thus you may ſee, that by dividing the Radius of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial circle into four equal parts, you may deſcribe your whole Dial, if it hath no Declination; for having with this Radius pricked out the lines of 3 and 9, and placed the lines for 10 and 11, theſe two diſtances from the hour of 12 ſhall give the like for the hour of 1 and 2 on the other ſide of the meridian, and having drawn the lines for 7 and 8, by the former rules, you may take their diſtances from the hour of 6, and place them on the other ſide of the Dial from 6 to 5, and 4: ſo have you all your hour-lines drawn, and yet we have not out-run the limits of our plane, which is an

               <p>But if it had been the North face of this plane, you muſt have proceeded in all things, as before, but onely in placing the Dial, and naming the honrs; for if it be the North face, the center muſt be in the lower part of the meridian line, and the ſtile and hour-lines point upwards, as you may ſee in this figure following.</p>

               <p>ALL thoſe planes that have their Horizontal line lying
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168528:43"/>Eaſt and Weſt, are in that reſpect ſaid to be direct vertical planes; if they be alſo upright, paſſing thorow the Zenith, they are erect direct vertical planes; if they incline to the pole, they are direct Polar planes; if to the Equinoctial, they are called Equinoctial planes, and are deſcribed before: if to none of theſe three points, they are then called direct verticals inclining.</p>
               <p>In all Dials that decline not, two things muſt be had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can make the Dial, the firſt is, the meridian or 12 a clock line, wherein the cock muſt ſtand, and the ſecond is the elevation of the pole above the ſame line.</p>
               <p>For the Horizontal plane, the meridian line is drawn by the fourth Chapter, and the elevation of the pole above the plane is alwayes equal to the latitude of the place; and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect direct verticals, the perpendicular or vertical line is the meridian or 12 a clock line, and the elevation of the pole above the plane is alwayes equal to the complement of the Latitude, the North Pole being elevated above the North face, and the South pole above the South face thereof.</p>
               <p>And in theſe verticals inclining being direct, the line of inclination is their meridian, and line wherein the cock muſt ſtand, but for the elevation of the cock, we muſt firſt conſider, whether the plane inclines towards the South, or towards the North, if it inclineth towards the South, adde the inclination to your latitude, the ſumme of both ſhall be the elevation of the pole above the plane, and if the ſumme ſhall be juſt 90 degrees, it is an Equinoctial plane, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed before in the fifth Chapter; but if the ſumme ſhall exceed 90 degrees, take it out of 180, and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſhall be the elevation of the pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>As for example, in the latitude of 52 degr. 30 min let a plane be found to incline Southwards 20 degrees, this 20 degrees added to 52 degrees 30 min. the latitude of the place, the ſumme will be 72 deg. 30 min. the elevation of the pole above the plane, with which you may proceed to draw a Dial by the eighth or ninth Chapters as if it were a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168528:43"/>plane, for their difference is nothing, but in the height of the ſtile, which is the elevation of the Pole above the plane. For this plane ſhall be parallel to that Horizon, whoſe latitude is 72 deg. 30 min. lying both under one and the ſame meridian.</p>
               <p>But if the inclination be Northward, compare the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with your latitude, and take leſſer out of the greater; ſo ſhall the difference be the elevation of the Pole above the plane, but if there be no difference, it is a direct polar plane, and is deſcribed before in the ſixth chapter.</p>
               <p>As in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. a plane being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to incline towards the North 25 deg. this 25 deg. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of 52 deg. 30 min. leaveth 27 deg. and 30 m. for the elevation of the Pole above the plane. Now this plane being parallel to that Horizon, whoſe latitude is 27 d. 30 min. lying both under one and the ſame Meridian, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may proceed to make this Dial, as if you were to make an horizontal Dial in that Countrey.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe planes have two faces; one towards the Zenith, the other towards the Nadir: but what is ſaid of the one is common to the other; they onely differ in this, the one hath the South, the other hath the North Pole ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above their faces.</p>
               <p>For upon the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is leſſe then the latitude of the place, on the under faces of all North incliners, whoſe inclintion is greater then the latitude of the place: and on the upper faces of all South incliners, the North Pole is elevated; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, on the under faces of all North incliners, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is leſſe then the latitude of the place, on the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe inclination is greater then the latitude of the place; and on the under faces of all South incliners, the South Pole is elevated: unto one of which Poles, the ſtiles of all Dials muſt point directly.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> To draw a Dial upon an erect, or vertical plane declining, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called a South or North erect declining Dial.</head>
               <p>ALL upright planes whereon a man may draw a verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal line; are in that reſpect ſaid to be erect or vertical, if their horizontal line ſhall lie directly Eaſt and Weſt, they are direct vertical planes; if directly North and South, they are properly called Meridian planes, and are deſcribed before.</p>
               <p>If they behold none of theſe four principal parts of the world, but ſhall ſtand between the prime vertical circle, and the Meridian, they are then called by the general name of declining verticals, or by the name of South or North erect declining planes.</p>
               <p>In all ſuch declining planes, becauſe the Meridian of the place (which in all upright planes is the vertical line, and ſerveth for the hour of 12) and the Meridian of the plane deflecteth one from the other, therefore we muſt find out and place the Meridian of the plane, (which is the line over which the ſtile directly hangeth, and is here called the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile) and likewiſe the elevation of the Pole above the plane: both which may be eaſily performed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, draw a blinde line parallel to the Horizon, which may be the line A B and from a point therein as at C, let fall the perpendicular C D, ſerving for the Meridian of the place, and the houre of 12, and through ſome place of this Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian as at E, draw the line F G at right angles.</p>
               <p>Then having by the third chapter examined this plane, and finding it to decline 30 deg. from the South towards the Eaſt, I draw an arch of a circle upon the center C, with my compaſſes opened to the Radius of the Scale; in which arch I place the declination of the plane from E to H, on the ſame ſide of the Meridian with the declination of the plane, as here you ſee, then ſet the complement of the latitude, which is 37 degrees 30 minutes in the ſame arch from E to M, &amp; draw the line C H for the declination of the plane, and the line C M G cutting the line F G in the point G for the complement of your latitude.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:168528:44"/>
               <p>This being done, take the diſtance E G, and ſet it in the line of declination from C to S, from which point S draw the line S L ſquare to the Meridian C D,<note place="margin">Here note, that in all decliners, the Subſtile go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the meridian, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that coaſt which is contrary to the coaſt of the planes declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> then take S L and ſet it from E to O in the line E F, and draw the line C O, which is the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of this plane, or the line of the Subſtile, wherein the ſtile muſt ſtand directly up from the plane, then through the point O draw the line P K, ſquare to the Subſtile C O, which ſhall be the touch-line, or line of contingence.</p>
               <p>Then take the diſtance C L, and ſet it in the line of contingence from O to P, and draw the line C P, for the ſtile.</p>

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:168528:45"/>
               <p>This done, ſet one foot in the point O, and with the other take the ſhorteſt: extent unto the ſtile C P, with this diſtance, one foot remaining ſtill in the point O, the other turned towards C, make a mark at <hi>y</hi> in the line of the Subſtile, which ſhall be the center whereon you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Aequinoctial circle.</p>
               <p>Now having drawn the line N T through the center C, and parallel to the touch-line I K, which will be ſquare to the Subſtile C O, I take the diſtance O <hi>y,</hi> which is the Radius upon which the Equinoctial circle was drawn, and place it on both ſides the Subſtile, in the line of contingence from O to I, and from O to K, and in his parallel line from C to G, and from C to R, and draw G I and R K, then laying your rule upon the point <hi>y,</hi> the center of the Equinoctial, and <hi>a</hi> the point of interſection of the touch-line with the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and where it cutteth the circles circumference, there muſt you begin to divide it into 24 equal parts, but thoſe ſix ſhall be onely in uſe which are next the line of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that is, three of each ſide of the ſubſtile next thereunto.</p>
               <p>Then place your Ruler upon the center <hi>y,</hi> and upon each of theſe ſix points of the Equator, and where it toucheth the line of contingence, there make markes, by which and the center C, draw thoſe ſix hour-lines next the Subſtilar; which ſhall all fall between the points I and K, in the touch-line, three whereof ſhall fall betwixt O and K, and three betwixt O and I, thus have you 6 of your 12 hours, <hi>viz.</hi> 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 and 7, then take the diſtance from the point O to the interſection of the hour of 12 with the touch-line, and place it from O to <hi>b,</hi> and from G to N, then laying your Rule upon theſe two points N and <hi>b,</hi> where it ſhall croſſe the line G I, ſhall be the point through which you may draw the ſix a clock hour-line, in like manner, take the diſtance from O to the line for 11 a clock, and ſet it from O to <hi>c,</hi> and from G to Z, then lay the Rule upon C and Z, and where it ſhall cut the line, G I ſhall be the point through which you ſhall draw the 5 a clock hour-line, and ſo placing the diſtance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168528:45"/>O 10 from O to <hi>g,</hi> and from G to V, and laying the Rule upon V and <hi>g,</hi> you ſhall find the point in the line G I, through which you may draw the 4 a clock hour-line: in like manner may you proceed with the other ſide.</p>
               <p>For taking the diſtance from the point O to the line of 9, and ſetting it from O to <hi>h,</hi> and from R to <hi>x,</hi> and laying the Rule upon the points <hi>h</hi> and <hi>x,</hi> where you ſhall ſee it cut the line R K, there ſhall be the point, through which you ſhall draw the 3 a clock hour-line.</p>
               <p>And ſo you may take the diſtances from O to the line of 8 and 7. and place them from O to <hi>d</hi> and <hi>m,</hi> and from R to W and T, and ſo by laying your Rule upon the points W <hi>d</hi> and T <hi>m,</hi> where it ſhall croſſe the line R K, there ſhall be the points through which the hour-lines of 2 &amp; 1 ſhall be drawn.</p>
               <p>The Dial being thus drawn upon the South-eaſt face of this plane let the ſtile be fixed in the center C, ſo that it may hang directly over the Subſtile C O, making an angle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with equal to the angle P C O.</p>
               <p>The ſtile with the ſubſtile muſt here point downwards, becauſe in all upright planes declining from the South, the South pole is elevated; and in all upright planes declining from the North, the North pole is elevated.</p>
               <p>Therefore if you were to make a Dial to the North face of this plane, you muſt make choice of your center C in the lower part of the meridian C D, that the ſtile with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile may have room to point upwards.</p>
               <p>This Dial being made on paper for the South-eaſt face of this plane, will alſo ſerve for the North-weſt face thereof, if you turn it upſide down, ſo that the ſtile with the Subſtile may point upwards, and the paper being oiled or pricked through, ſo that you may take the back-ſide thereof for the foreſide, without altering the numbers ſet to the hours.</p>
               <p>And the fore-ſide of this pattern, turned upſide down, ſo that the cock may point upwards, ſhall ſerve for the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt face of a plane having the ſame declination; onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the numbers ſet to the hours.</p>
               <p>This paper being oiled, if you do but change the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168528:46"/>for the foreſide; and the numbers ſet to the hours, ſtill keeping the center upwards, and the ſtile pointing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, this pattern will ſerve for the South-weſt face of a plane, whoſe declination is the ſame as before.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee by diligent obſervation, this pattern may be made to ſerve for four Dials, which being well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, will be a great help to the Artiſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> How to draw a Dial upon an horizontal plane, otherwiſe then in the eighth Chapter was ſhewed.</head>
               <p>ALthough I have plainly and perfectly ſhewed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the horizontal, the direct South or North, as well erect as inclining; and the South or North crect declining Dials, in the four former Chapters: yet to ſatisfie them that delight in variety, I have here declared another way, whereby you may make them moſt artificially and geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically, not being tied to the uſe of the Canons; (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all others is moſt exact, but not ſo eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) nor to any one Inſtrument, (which may be abſent from me, when I ſhould need it) although in this Treatiſe I do perform the whole by a plain Quadrant.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the firſt Chapter, having found the plane to be horizontal, by the fourth Chapter draw the Meridian line A B, and croſſe it at right angles in the middle with the line D E, which is the line of Eaſt and Weſt, and ſerveth for the hour of ſix at morning, and ſix at evening.</p>
               <p>Then upon the center C (which is the point of interſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) deſcribe a circle for your Dial as large as your plane will give leave, which let be the circle A D B E; then take the latiude of the place, which is here 52 deg. 30 min. and ſet it from A to N, in the quadrant A D, and draw the line C N S, then from A raiſe the perpendicular A S, to cut the line C S at S, ſo ſhall the Triangle A C S be the true pattern for your cock; this being done, divide the two quarters of your circle A E and A D, each into ſix equal parts, ſo ſhall you have in each Quadrant five ponits, by which you may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168528:46"/>draw the five Chord lines I F G H and A, as here you ſee; then take one half of the Chord-line A, and ſet it in the line of the ſtile from C to O, from which point O take the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt extent unto the meridian; with this diſtance ſetting one foot in the point A, with the other make a mark on each ſide of the Meridian, in the ſame Chord-line A, through which points you ſhall draw the hour-lines of 1 and 11.</p>
               <figure>

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:168528:47"/>
               <p>So likewiſe you may take one half of the chord H, and place it in the line of the ſtile from C to K, from which point K take the ſhorteſt extent unto the meridian, with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſet one foot in H, and with the other make on each ſide the meridian a mark in the ſame chord-line, through which you ſhall draw the hour-lines of 2 and 10.</p>
               <p>And thus you may proceed with the reſt of the lines, as the Figure will ſhew better then many words; for this is ſooner wrought then ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And if you would have the hours before and after ſix, you may extend them through the center, as was ſhewed in the eighth Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe work of this is almoſt like unto the other before; the difference is onely in the elevation of the Pole above the plane: for in the horizontal plane, the elevation is equal to the latitude of the place; and in all direct verticals being erect, the elevation of the pole above the plane is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the complement of the latitude, but if they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards the horizon, then ſhall you finde the elevation of the pole above the plane, by the 10 Chapter.</p>
               <p>The elevation of the pole above the plane being known, the making of theſe Dials are all alike: therefore by the ſecond Chapter draw the line E W parallel to the horizon, and from the middle thereof let fall the perpendicular Z N which ſhall be the meridian of the plane, and alſo the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the place, ſerving for the line of 12, and alſo for the ſubſtile, over which the ſtile muſt hang, both in erect and inclining planes being direct.</p>
               <p>Then upon the center Z deſcribe your Dials circle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Semicircle E N W, and ſeeing this plane is erect, and alſo direct, therefore the elevation of the pole above the plane is 37 d. 30 m. equal to the complement of our latitude,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168528:47"/>which take from your Scale, &amp; place it from N to H in your Dials ſemicicircle, and draw the line Z H S for the line of the ſtile; then from the end of the meridian, as at N, draw the crooked line N S, cutting the line of the ſtile in the point S, ſo ſhall the triangle S Z N be the true pattern for your cock.</p>

               <p>This being done, divide each quadrant of your Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle into ſix equal parts, ſo ſhall you have five points, by which you may draw five chord-lines, cutting the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an at right angles in the points I K L M N.</p>
               <p>This being done, take the half of each chord, and place it from the center Z, along upon the line of the ſtile, as here you ſee; the half of the Chord N from Z to A, and one half the chord M, from Z to B, and half the chord L from Z to C, and one half the chord-lines I and K, ſet from Z unto D and G: now from each of theſe points take the neereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unto the Meridian Z N, &amp; place them upon their proper chord-lines from the meridian on both ſides thereof, ſo ſhall
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168528:48"/>you have two points on each Chord, through which you ſhall draw the hour-lines from the center of your Dial, as the ſhorteſt extent from the point A unto the meridian, ſet in the Chord N from the Meridian both wayes, ſhall give you the points for 1 and 11; ſo ſhall the ſhorteſt extent from the point B (being placed from the Meridian both wayes in the Chord M) give you the two points for 10 and 2, and ſo you may proceed with the reſt; thus doing, you ſhall have in each chord two points, on each ſide the meridian one; through which, and from the center Z, you may draw your hour-lines at pleaſure, without exceeding the limits of your plane. And ſeeing this is the South face of this plane, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtile muſt point downwards, being fixed in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Z in the upper part of the meridian line Z N, over which the ſtile muſt directly hang, making therewith an angle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the angle N Z S.</p>

               <p>IN all erect declining planes, when the declination is found, there is three things more to be conſidered before we can come to the drawing of the Dial.</p>

               <p>HAving by the third Chapter found the declination of this plane to be 32 degrees, and ſo by the laſt Chapter found the elevation of the pole above the plane to be 31 deg. 5 min. and the diſtance of the ſubſtile from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian to be 22 degr. 8 minutes, and likewiſe the angle of inclination between both meridians to be 38 degreees 13 minutes, we may proceed to make the Diall after this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, draw the horizontal W E, and the perpendicular line Z N, croſſing the horizontal line at right angles, which is the meridian of the place, and the line of 12.</p>
               <p>Then in the meridian make choice of ſome point with moſt convenience, as the center C, whereupon deſcribe your Dial-circle E N W.</p>
               <p>Then take a chord of 22 degrees 8 minutes from your Scale, for the diſtance of the ſubſtile from the Meridian, and inſcribe it into this circle from the Meridian; upon theſe conditions, that if the plane declineth weſt, then muſt the ſubſtile be placed Eaſt of the plumb line; but if the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall be Eaſt, then muſt the ſubſtile be placed weſt from the Meridian, as here it is.</p>
               <p>This 22 degrees 8 minutes being ſet in the Dial-circle from the Meridian at N unto M, I draw the line C M for the ſubſtile: then through the center C, draw the diameter A B, making right angles with the ſubſtile C M, above this Diameter there needs no hour lines to be drawn, if the plane be erect.</p>
               <p>Then take 31 deg. 5 min. and ſet them from M to D, and draw the line C D S for the ſtile, then from M the end of the ſtile draw the crooked line M S, cutting the line of the ſtile in the point S, ſo ſhall the triangle S C M be the true pattern for the cock of the Dial.</p>

               <p>When you have drawn, and deſcribed your Dial upon paper for any plane whaſoever, you may cut off the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, cock and all, with a leſſer Circle then the Dial circle, either with a concentrique or an excentrique circle, and ſo make a Dial leſſe then the Circle by which you framed it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, draw the horizontal line A B, ſerving for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian and hour of 12, about the middle of this line make choice of a center at C, upon which deſcribe a Circle for your Dial, as A D B E.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing this is the upper face of the plane, ſet 33 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 5 minutes the diſtance of the ſubſtile from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, in the Dials Circle from the North end of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line upwards, as from B to H, and draw the line C H for the Subſtile.

               <p>HAving by the ſecond Chapter found the inclination to be 25 deg. towards the North, and by the third Chapter the declination from the South towards the Eaſt to be 35 deg. and ſo by the laſt Chapter the meridians aſcenſion to be 57 deg. 36 min. The elevation of the Pole above the plane 30 deg. 33 min. The diſtance of the ſubſtile from the meridian 8 degrees 35 min. And the inclination of both meridians 17 deg. 30 min. we may proceed to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al after this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Draw the line A B parallel to the Horizon, in which line make choice of a center as at C, whereon deſcribe your Dial circle A D B E A, then take 57 deg. 36 min. the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168528:55"/>aſcenſion, and ſet it from B that end of the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line with the declination of the plane, as from B to N, and draw the line C N for the hour of 12.</p>
               <p>Then ſet 8 deg. 35 min. the diſtance of the ſubſtile from the Meridian from N to M (on that ſide the meridian which is contrary to the declination of the plane) and draw the line C M for the ſubſtile. And ſet 30 deg. 33 min. from M to D, and draw the line C D unto S, and from the end of the ſubſtile draw the crooked line M S, cutting the line of the Stile in S, ſo ſhall the Triangle M C S be the true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of this Dials Cock.</p>
               <p>Then ſet 17 deg. 30 min. the inclination of meridians from M unto O, which is the point where you muſt begin to divide your Dial circle into 24 equal parts: from which points let down ſo many perpendiculars to the ſubſtile, as there ſhall be points on that ſide the Diameter F E next the ſubſtile, and ſo by working as before hath been ſhewed, you may draw the hour-lines, and ſet up the ſtile as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer planes.</p>
               <p>Now here I would have you well to conſider what hath been here ſpoken concerning theſe kind of Dials, and alſo what followeth the ſame, for if you mark the diverſity which doth ariſe by reaſon of the elevation of the meridian, you may perceive thereby three ſundry kinds of Dials to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of a North inclining plane declining, and alſo in a South inclining declining plane, yet in effect they are but one if you conſider what followeth here concerning them, in all which, the ſtile with the ſubſtile, and ſuch like mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, are found out according to the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Therefore having drawn your horizontal line, you muſt conſider which pole is elevated above your plane, and how to place the meridian from the Horizontal line. For upon the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe meridians ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is leſſe then the Latitude of the place: on the under faces of all North incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the Latitude of the place: and on the upper fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all South incliners, the North Pole is elevated.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:168528:55"/>

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:168528:56"/>
               <p>Now for placing the Meridian from the horizontal line; upon the upper faces of all South incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the Latitudes complement: on the under faces of all South incliners, whoſe meridians elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is leſſe then the Latitudes complement; on the under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all North incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the Latitude of the place: and on the upper fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all North incliners, whoſe Meridians elevation is leſs then the Latitude of the place: the Meridian muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the Horizontal line as here in this example.</p>
               <p>And therefore by the contrary; Upon the upper faces of all South incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is leſſe then the Latitudes complement: On the under faces of all South incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes complement: On the under faces of all North in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners, whoſe meridians elevation is leſſe then the Latitude of the place: And on the upper faces of all North incliners, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the Latitude of the place; the Meridian muſt be placed below the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal line.</p>
               <p>But here you muſt obſerve, that if it be either the upper or under faces of a South inclining plane, whoſe meridians elevation is greater then the Latitudes complement: or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the upper or under faces of a North inclining plane, whoſe meridians elevation is leſſe then the Latitude of the place; that then the Meridian muſt be placed from that end of the horizontal line with the declination of the plane: But on all the other faces of theſe kinds of planes the meridian muſt be placed from that end of the horizontal line, which is contrary to the declination of the plane.</p>
               <p>And here note, that if the inclination ſhall be Southward and the elevation of the meridian equal to the complement of your Latitude, then ſhall the ſubſtile lie ſquare to the Meridian.</p>
               <p>And if the inclination ſhall be Northward, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Meridian equal to the Latitude of the place, then ſhall neither Pole be elevated above this plane, and therefore ſhall be a Polar declining plane. Wherein the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168528:56"/>being placed according to his aſcenſion from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line, ſhall be in place of the ſubſtile, unto which if you draw a line ſquare, it ſhall ſerve for the Equator. Then ſet one foot of your compaſſes in the interſection of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile with the Equator, and open the other to any convenient diſtance upon the ſubſtile, and deſcribe the Equinoctial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as in the ſixth Chapter of this Book was ſhewed:) upon the center whereof make an angle with the line of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, equal to the inclination of both meridians, namely, the meridian of the plane, and the meridian of the place, which ſhall ſhew you where to begin to divide your Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial circle into 24 equal parts.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being known, you may proceed to make your Dial, and ſet up the cock according to the 6 chapter.</p>
               <p>As for example, in our Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. a plane is propoſed to decline from the South towards the Eaſt 35 deg. as before, but inclining Northward 57 deg. 50 min. the Meridians aſcenſion, by the 18 chapter will be found to be 69 deg. 33 min. and his elevation 52 deg. 30 min. equal to the latitude of the place, and therefore neither pole is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above this Plane, and ſo no diſtance between the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile and the Meridian: for the Meridian, and the ſtile with the ſubſtile will be as it were all one line, which is the Axle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the world: ſo that here the ſtile muſt be parallel to the plane, and the hour-lines parallel one to the other, as in the Meridian and direct Polar Planes. Therefore firſt draw the Horizontal line A B, wherein make choice of a center, as at C, whereon deſcribe an occult arch of a circle, as B E: then into this arch inſcribe the meridians aſcenſion 69 deg. 33 min. from B to E, and draw the line C E for the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the plane, and for the ſubſtilar: and if you draw a line ſquare to this ſubſtilar, it ſhall be the Equator.</p>
               <p>Then ſet one foot of your compaſſes in the point of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection D, and with the other opened to a convenient wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, draw a circle for the Equator, unto which you may draw two touch-lines ſquare to the ſubſtile, as in the direct Polar plane.</p>

               <p>Having prepared a piece of Box or Braſſe in manner of a Quadrant, draw thereon the two Semidiameters A B and A C, equally diſtant or parallel to the edges, cutting one the other at right angles in the center A, upon which center A, with the Semidiameter A B or A C, deſcribe the arch B C, this arch is called the limb; and is divided into 90 equal parts or degrees; and ſub-divided into as many parts as quantity will give leave, being numbered from the left hand towards the right after the uſual manner.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:168528:58"/>

               <p>This being done, draw the line D E from the Sine of 45 degrees counted in the line of Sines unto 45 degrees counted in the Quadrant, then from the point E draw the line E F

               <p>Then at the ſame inſtant, as neer as may be, take the Suns altitude, that ſo you may find the Suns Azimuth from the Eaſt or Weſt points, by the 21 chap. of the fourth Book.</p>

               <p>IN the drawing of all theſe kinde of Dials, by help of this quadrant, when the latitude of the place and the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plane is known, two things more is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; Firſt, the elevation of the Pole above the plane: Secondly, the inclination of the Meridian of the plane, to the Meridian of the place, both which will ſpeedily be found when you are ready for them.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, draw the line D A F as before, from the middle whereof let fall the perpendicular A B for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilar, and at the diſtance of the tangent line D E, draw the line C B E parallel to the line D A F.</p>
               <p>Now to find the elevation of the pole above the plane, lay the threed upon the co-ſine of the latitude counted on the limb, and take it over at the neereſt extent from the co-ſine of the declination, which diſtance ſhall be the ſine of the elevation of the pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>So the declination of the plane being 32 deg in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 52 deg. 30 min. the elevation of the pole above the plane will be 31 deg. 5 min. from the ſine of which take the neereſt extent unto the line of latitudes, this diſtance ſet from A to D and F both wayes, and from B to C and E, and draw the lines D C and E F, making the long ſquare C D F E, as in the former chapter.</p>
               <p>For the inclination of Meridians, take the ſine of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the plane, and ſetting one foot in the co-ſine of the ſtiles elevation, with the other lay the threed to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt diſtance, ſo ſhall it ſhew upon the limb the inclination of Meridians to be 38 deg. 13 min.</p>

               <p>The bead being thus fitted, apply it to every hour-line, by removing the threed, as firſt, I remove it to the lines <hi>m h</hi> and B <hi>g,</hi> and it will cut the line D E upon the quadrant in <hi>r</hi> and <hi>q,</hi> therefore I take D <hi>r</hi> and D <hi>q,</hi> and prick them down from D to 5 and 4, with theſe ſame diſtances open the threed as before from the ſine of 90; and by taking it over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, you ſhall have the diſtances B 11 and B 10: again, the bead being applyed to the line <hi>k</hi> E: the threed will cut the co-tangent line in T, therefore take F T from your quadrant, and prick it down here from F to 1, with this ſame diſtance, open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. as before, and by taking it over from the ſine of the height of the pole above the plane, you ſhall have the diſtance B 7: then again, the bead being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the lines <hi>l</hi> O and E P, the threed will cut the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent line F E in V and W, therefore take F V and F W, and prick them down here from F to 2 and 3, with theſe diſtances open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. and take them over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, ſo ſhall you have the diſtances B 8 and B 9, thus have you the twelve houres pricked down, by which points and the center A, you may draw the houre-lines, as here you ſee.</p>
               <p>In the like manner may the half hours be ſupplyed.</p>
               <p>The Dial being thus drawn on paper, you muſt place it ſo upon the plane, that the twelve a clock houre-line may be perpendicular unto the horizon, according to the 11 or 15 chapters of the third Book.</p>
               <p>Note, that if the inclination of Meridians ſhall be more then 45 deg. ſo that the threed doth cut the co-taugent line F E, then you muſt take the diſtance from F to the threed, and prick it down either from D or from F, upon the line D C or F E for the twelve a clock point, according as the plane ſhall decline either Eaſtward or Weſtward, and his parallel taken from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, ſhall give the diſtance from B to 6, and ſo of the reſt.</p>

               <p>For the elevation of the Pole above the plane, lay the threed upon the Latitude counted in the limb, and take it over at the neereſt extent from the co-ſine of the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which diſtance ſhall be the ſine of the elevation of the Pole above the plane.</p>
               <p>So in the Latitude of 52 deg. 30 minutes, if a plane ſhall incline 40 degrees to the Horizon, the height of the ſtile will be 37 deg. 26 min. with which you may proceed to make your parallelogram or long ſquare, as in the former chapters.</p>
               <p>Then for the inclination of Meridians, take the ſine of the inclination of the plane with your Compaſſes, and ſetting one foot in the co-ſine of the Poles elevation above the plane, with the other lay the threed to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt diſtance, and it will ſhew upon the limb the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required.</p>
               <p>Thus in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. if a plane ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline 40 deg. to the horizon, the inclination of both Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, will be 54 deg. 2 min.

               <p>And you may alſo ſee where the threed cutteth the co-tangent line E F, that ſo you may take the diſtance from the point F upon the quadrant, unto the point of interſection of the threed with the co-tangent line; this diſtance you muſt ſet here from D to 12, and with the ſame, open the threed from the ſine of 90 deg. as before, and take it over from the ſine of the height of the ſtile, which ſhall be the diſtance from B to 6, and ſo you may proceed to prick down the reſt of the hours as in the laſt chapter was ſhewed.</p>
               <p>In all theſe planes you muſt place the line of twelve pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon, according to the 17 chapter of the third Book, in which chapter is fully ſhewed the true ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Dial upon the plane.</p>

               <p>IN the making of theſe kinde of Dials by this quadrant, when the latitude of the place, and the declination, and inclination of the plane is known, there is ſix things more to be conſidered before we can come to the drawing of this Dial upon the plane.</p>

And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:168528:76"/>all ſmal Circles, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as divide the Sphere unequally, are Conick Sections, namely, either Eclypſes, Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola's, or Parabola's, except they be drawn upon ſuch planes as lie parallel to thoſe ſmaller Circles, and therefore the parallels of declination in the Equinoctial plane, and the circles of Altitude in an Horizontal plane, are perfect circles. For the Equinoctial Dial lying in the very plain of the Equinoctial circle is parallel to all the parallels of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: as the Horizontal Dial lying in the very plain of the Horizon, is parallel to all the Almicanters or circles of Altitude.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Sun in his courſe moveth continually between the two Tropicks, and never exceedeth thoſe bounds: ſo likewiſe, all Aſtronomical concluſions that are to be drawn upon any Dial plane, are limited either by the Equinoctial: or by one or both of the Tropicks: therefore it is requiſite: firſt, to ſhew you how to deſcribe the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial and the Tropicks upon all kinde of planes, becauſe it is them that limit and conſine all other intermediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels, whether they be of the Suns entrance into the Signes or the Diurnal arches for the length of the day.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe parallels being placed in your Trigon according to their true declination from the Equinoctial, they are to be trans erred into your plane in all reſpects as the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks were, by taking out of your Trigon the diſtances from the line O R, to the ſeveral points where the hours croſſe the parallel, and place the ſame diſtances upon your plane from the Equinoctial upon the reſpective hour-lines, from which they were taken our of the Trigon, and through theſe points draw the lines in your plane, which ſhall be the true parallels of the Suns courſe at his entrance into all the 12 Signes of the Zodiaque, to which you may ſet the characters of the Signes, as you ſee done in the figure.</p>
                  <p>¶ And here note, that if you draw upon your plane the halves and quarters of houres, and put them into your Trigon and transfer them to your plane again, you ſhall then have more points, through which your parallels muſt paſſe, which will much help you in the drawing thereof, (eſpecially in large planes) for there is no better way to draw theſe kind of lines, but by finding a great number of points, and ſo draw them by hand.</p>
                  <p>¶ Note alſo; that whatſoever is here ſpoken of the Eaſt and Weſt Dials, the ſame in all reſpects is to be obſerved in putting on the parallels of the Suns courſe in all planes that lie parallel to the Axis of the world, as the Polar, whether direct or declining.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe kindes of planes, as the Eaſt, Weſt, and Polar, the ſtile were beſt to be made of a ſtraight piece of wyer, equal in length to the line E G, fixed in the point E, ſtanding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:168528:79"/>perpendicular unto the plane, the end thereof at G being filed very fine and ſharpe, proportionable to the greatneſſe of the plane, for all theſe Aſtronomical concluſions are ſhewed (not by the ſhadow of the whole length of the ſtile, but) by the very Apex or top thereof, and therefore the more care ought to be had in the forming and making of it.</p>
                  <p>¶ The line M E N in the former Eaſt Dial is called the Horizontal line, becauſe it lyeth parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and by the meeting of the parallels of the Suns courſe with this line, the riſing of the Sun may be neerly eſtimated. for there you ſee that the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> cutteth this line neer the point M, which is a little before the four a clock hour-line, which ſhewed, that when the Sun is in the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> he riſeth ſomwhat before four in the morning, in like manner the Tropick of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn</hi> cutteth the Horizontal line ſomething after 8, at which time the Sun riſeth being in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> but this by the way, the farther uſe of this line ſhall be ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>I have been the larger in the work of this plane, becauſe I intend to be more brief in thoſe which follow, and this being well and truly underſtood, the others will need very few precepts or examples; yet I ſhall not omit any thing, but make it apparent to the meaneſt capacity.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168528:80"/>the full North and South reclining or inclining, all which in thoſe latitudes, whoſe complement is equal to the height of the ſtile they are erect direct planes, and in thoſe lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes which are equal to the height of the ſtile above ſuch reclining plains, they are Horizontal planes. One example therefore in one plane will be ſufficient for the reſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. Let it be required to deſcribe the Equinoctial, and the two Tropicks in a full South erect plane.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn your Diall with the houres, halves and quarters, as alſo the line C <hi>Q</hi> for the ſtile, you muſt make choice of ſome convenient point in the ſtile, as at S, for the Nodus or knot which muſt give the ſhadow to the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks and other parallels of declination, for all theſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical concluſions are not ſhewed by the ſhadow of the whole length of the ſtile or Axis, as the houre is, but by ſome point therein which repreſenteth the center of the earth, which in the Dial following is the points, and the triangular ſtile in that Dial is repreſented by the triangle C S L, whereof C L is called the ſubſtilar, C S the Axis of the ſtile and S L the perpendicular ſtile, the top of which <hi>viz.</hi> S, is the point we are in this place to reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The Dial being drawn, and the Triangle C S L made equal to the Cock of the Dial, you muſt upon a piece of paſtboard draw the Triangle O P R equal to the ſtile in your Dial C S L, making R O equall to C L the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, P O equal to C S the Axis of the ſtile, and P R equal to S L the length of the perpendicular ſtile.</p>

Secondly, take out of your plane the diſtance C <hi>c,</hi> and place that in your Trigon from O unto <hi>c</hi> and draw the line O <hi>c</hi> 2, repreſenting the hour-lines of 2 or 10. Thirdly, take out of your plane the diſtance C <hi>d,</hi> and place it in your Trigon from O unto <hi>d,</hi> and draw the line O <hi>d</hi> 3, for the hours of 9 and 3. Fourthly, from our plane take the diſtance C <hi>e,</hi> and ſet in your Trigon from O unto <hi>e,</hi> and draw the line O <hi>e</hi> 4 repreſenting the hours of 4 and 8.

                  <p>¶ Now before you draw the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> it is neceſſary to draw the Horizontal line of your plane A B, which line in all upright planes muſt be drawn through the point L, the foot of the perpendicular ſtile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the Meridian or line of 12: And in all planes whatſoever, this line muſt be drawn through the interſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Equinoctial with the houre of ſix.

               <p>THe parallels of the length of the day, and thoſe of the Signes are inſcribed upon all kinde of planes by one and the ſame Rules, they being in the Sphere the ſame Circles, ſo that as when you put on the parallels of the Suns entrance into the 12 Signes, you ſeek what declination he hath, and accordingly proceed as before; ſo now for the parallels of the length of the day you muſt ſeeke what d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination the Sun hath at ſuch a length of the day as you would put into your plane, which that you may do, I have here added the Rule following.</p>
               <p>¶ Conſider how much longer or ſhorter your day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed is then 12 hours, and take the difference, then the proportion will be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Sine of</hi> 90 <hi>deg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is to the Sine of halfe the difference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So is the Tangent complement of the latitude of the place,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Tangent of the declination that the Sun ſhall have when the day is at ſuch a length as you require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for example, Let it be required to know what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination the Sun ſhall have when the day is 16 hours long in the latitude of 52 deg. 30 min. The difference betwixt 16 hours and 12 hours is 4 hours, (or 60 deg.) the half of which is 30 deg. Therefore ſay,

               <p>By which table you may ſee that when the day is 12 hours long the Sun hath then no declination, but is in the Equinoctial: but when the day is either 11 or 13 hours long, the declination is then 5 deg. 43 min. and when one day is either 9 or 15 hours long, the Sun hath 16 deg. 22 min. of declination, and ſo for the reſt, as in the Table.</p>
               <p>For the placing of theſe parallels of the length of the day upon any of the fore-mentioned planes: you muſt inſert theſe angles and declination unto your Trigon between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks; and proceed in all reſpects as before. I will therefore give you but one example, which ſhall be in a full South plane, upon which and the Horizontal theſe arches doe appear moſt uniform.</p>
               <p>Now let it be required to draw the parallels of the Suns courſe, when the day is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 hours long: upon a full South plane in the Latitude of 52 deg. 30 min.</p>
               <p>Having drawn your Dial with hours, halves and quarters and alſo made choiſe of ſome convenient point in the ſtile to give the ſhadow, and draw the horizontal line C D,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168528:84"/>then make the triangle S A R in this Trigon equal to the triangle S A R in the following South Dial: as S A equal to the Axis of the ſtile, A R equal to the ſubſtilar, and R S, equal to the perpendicular ſtile: then draw the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular S G for the Equinoctial, and deſcribe the arch O G P, making G O and G P each of them 23 deg. 31 min. for the two Tropicks, which you muſt transfer into your plane as before.</p>

               <p>Now for the drawing of the parallels of the length of the day, you muſt have recourſe to the little table before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therein ſee what declination the Sun hath at ſuch a day as you would put into your plane, as when the day is either 8 or 16 hours long, the declination is 20 deg. 59 min. therefore place in your Trigon 20 deg. 59 m. from G unto <hi>a</hi> both wayes, and draw the lines S <hi>a</hi> and S <hi>a,</hi> marking them at the ends with 8 and 16 the length of the day for which they ſerve. Likewiſe, when the day is either 9 or 15 hours long, then the Suns declination is 16 deg. 22 min. therefore ſet 16 deg. 22 min. from G unto <hi>b</hi> both wayes, and draw S <hi>b</hi> and 8 <hi>b.</hi> Alſo when the day is either 10 or 14 hours long, then the declination is 11 deg. 14 min which ſet from G to <hi>c</hi> both wayes: and draw S <hi>c</hi> and S <hi>c.</hi> Laſtly, when the day is 11 or 13 hours long the declination is 5 deg. 43 min. which ſet from G unto <hi>d</hi> both wayes, and draw S <hi>d</hi> and S <hi>d,</hi> noting them with numbers anſwering to the length of the day, as you ſee in the Trigon, when the day is juſt 12 hours long it is Equinoctial and hath no declination, and is ſignified in the Trigon by the line S G.</p>
               <p>For the manner how to transfer theſe parallels of the length of the day into the plane, it is to be performed in all reſpects as in the former chapter for the inſerting of the Signes, not at all differing therefrom, and therefore I ſhall forbear to give you any farther inſtructions for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, but give you the figure of a South plane with theſe parallels drawn thereon, which will inſtruct more then a whole chapter of information.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the drawing of the parallels of the Signes and Diurnal arches in all kinde of planes. I will now proceed to ſhew you how ſome other Aſtronomical concluſions (which are very pleaſing and delightfull) may be inſcribed upon all ſorts of Dials.</p>

               <p>THe Italians account their hours from the Suns ſetting; and the Babylonians from his riſing, ſo that theſe kinde of hour-lines being drawn upon any plane, you know (by inſpection only) how many hours are paſt ſince the laſt ſetting or riſing of the Sun. The inſcription of

               <p>Your Dial being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, &amp; theſe parallels thus inſerted, the inſcription of theſe hour-lines is very eaſie and plain to be underſtood. To begin then with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Babyloniſh hours (which are the hours from the Suns riſing.) Firſt, It is apparent that when the day is 8 hours long, that the Sun riſeth at 8 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that at that time, the firſt hour after the Suns ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is 9 in the morning. Secondly, when the day is 12 hours long, the Sun riſeth at 6 in the morning, ſo that at that time the firſt houre after the Suns riſing is 7 in the morning. Thirdly, when the day is 16 hours long, the Sun riſeth at 4 in the morning, ſo that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168528:86"/>the firſt hour after his riſing is 5 in the morning, as plainly appeareth by this Table: By which you may perceive that when the day is 8 hours long, the ſeventh hour from Sun riſing is 3 in the afternoon. When the day is 12 hours long, the ſeventh hour from the Sun riſing is 1 in the afternoon. And when the day is 16 hours long, the ſeventh hour from the Suns riſing is 11 before noon as by this Table doth evidently appear. And therefore a ſtraight line drawn in your Dial through thoſe points where the common hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of your Dial croſſe the reſpective parallels of the dayes length, ſhall ſhew the true quantity of hours ſince the Suns riſing at all times of the yeare, which is the Baby lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh hour.</p>
               <p>For example, let it be required to draw the ſeventh hour from the Suns riſing in your Dial. Firſt, by the Table you ſee, that in the parallel of 8 hours for the length of the day, the ſeventh hour from the Suns riſing is 3 in the afternoon, therefore obſerve where the hour-line of three croſſeth the parallel of 8 hours, which is at <hi>a.</hi> Secondly, by the Table you ſee that in the parallel of 12 hours for the length of the day, the ſeventh hour from Sun riſing is then 1 in the afternoon, wherefore obſerve where the hour-line of 1 croſſeth the Equinoctial, which is at <hi>b.</hi> Thirdly, by the Table you ſee that in the parallel of 16 hours for the length of the day, the ſeventh hour from the Suns riſing is 11 before noon, therefore obſerve where the hour-line of 11 croſſeth the parallel of 16 hours, which is at <hi>c:</hi> then draw the ſtraight line <hi>a b c,</hi> which ſhall be the ſeventh Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh hour, or the ſeventh hour from the Suns riſing all the year long.</p>
               <p>And by this Rule, and the help of the Table, you may draw all the other hours from Sun riſing, as you ſee them drawn in the figure, and put numbers to them as you ſee there done.</p>

               <p>¶ 1 Note, That if any of the points you are to make uſe of for the drawing of any of theſe hours fall without your plane, you muſt in this caſe extend your hour-line, parallel and Equinoctial, beyond the limits of your Dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane, and there make uſe of the points, but you need ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the line you draw no farther then the bounds of the plane as here in the figure you ſee the firſt hour from Sun riſing croſſeth not the Equinoctial and the hour-line of 7 within the plane, but if the Equinoctial and the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of 7 were extended, it would croſſe.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:168528:87"/>
               <p>¶ 2 Note, That if any of the three points you are to make uſe of doe ſo far exceed the limits of your plane, that it will be either impoſſible (or at leaſt very troubleſome) to extend the hour-lines ſo far that then in that caſe any two of the three points will ſufficiently ſerve the turn.</p>
               <p>¶ 3 Note, that as the hours from Sun riſing were put into the plane, by the ſame Rule may the hours from Sun ſetting (or Italian hours) be inſerted, the difference being only in the numbring of them; the hours from the Sun riſing being numbred from the Weſt ſide to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal line by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, and the hours from the Suns ſetting are denominated from the Eaſt ſide of the Horizon, and numbred backwards by 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13, as in the figure doth evidently appear.</p>
               <p>¶ 4 Note, That theſe Italian and Babyloniſh hours are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed on all planes by help of this little Table, and the Rules and cautions delivered in this chapter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more examples were ſuperfluous.</p>

               <p>IT was the cuſtome of the Ancients to divide their day and alſo their night (whether long or ſhort) into 12 equal parts, beginning their day at the Suns riſing, and their night at the Suns ſetting: ſo that 14 of the clock at noon was alwayes the ſixth hour of their day, and 12 at night was alwayes the ſixth hour of their night, and according to this diviſion were their Dials drawn; ſo that all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the hours of their day were longer then the hours of their night; and all the Winter, the hours of their night were longer then thoſe of their day and when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, then the hours of their day and night were equal, and the ſame with thoſe of our account, but at all other times of the year different.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:168528:88"/>
               <p>The inſcribing of theſe hours into all kinde of planes is very eaſie, being much like the drawing of the Babyloniſh and Italian hours before taught.</p>
               <p>Having therefore drawn your Dial (which in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (for the avoiding of many figures) we will have to be the full South plane uſed before in chap. 2. of this Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix) with the hours, halves, and quarters, and alſo drawn the two Tropicks and the parallels of the length of the day thereupon, as you ſee here done in this figure. Then make choice of two parallels of the length of the day, which muſt be both of them equidiſtant from the Equinoctial, which let be the parallels of 9 hours and 15 hours, both which are three hours different from the Equinoctial on either ſide thereof, and theſe two parallels are the moſt convenient for

In the Horizontal plane they meet in a center with equal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. In all upright planes, whether direct or declining, they are parallel to the Meridian or line of 12. And in all reclining planes they meet together in a point which is the Zenith of the place. Theſe Azimuths being great circles in the Sphere; are therefore ſtraight lines in all planes, and may be drawn as followeth.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe the direct beams of the Sun can never ſhine upon the ſeeling of a Room, they muſt therefore be reflected thither by help of a ſmall piece of Looking-glaſſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently fixed in ſome Tranſam of the window, ſo that it may lie exactly parallel to the Horizon. The place being choſen, and the glaſſe therein fixed, you muſt draw upon the ſeeling of the Room a Meridian line, as you are taught in the former Books, which Meridian line muſt be ſo drawn that it may paſſe directly over the glaſſe before placed, which you may perceive how to doe by holding a threed and plummet from the top of the ſeeling till it fall directly upon the ſuperficies of the glaſſe.</p>
               <p>The foundation being thus laid, we will now proceed to the work, which among ſo many wayes as theſe are to perform it, I ſhall make choice of that which I ſuppoſe to be moſt familiar and eaſie. Draw therefore upon paper or otherwiſe an horizontal Dial for the Latitude in which you are, as is the horizontal Dial fore-going for the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 52 deg. 30 min. Then upon the center thereof at A, with the Radius of your line of Chords deſcribe the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle B C D, cutting the hour-lines in the points <hi>a b c d</hi> &amp; <hi>e</hi> then with your compaſſes you may meaſure the quantity of each hours diſtance from the Meridian, by taking the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from C to <hi>a, b, c, d,</hi> and <hi>e,</hi> ſo ſhall you find the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Meridian and 11 or 1 to be 12 degrees. Likewiſe the diſtance between the Meridian and 10 or 2 to be 24 degr. 37 min. and the diſtance between the Meridian
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168528:93"/>and 9 or 3, to be 38 deg. 25 min. and ſo of the reſt as by the figure, and the ſecond column of the Table doth appear, This done, take the complement of every of theſe angles. ſo ſhall the complement of 12 deg. be 78 deg. and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of 24 deg. 37 min. be 65 deg. 23 min. and ſo of all the reſt, as by the third column of the Table may appear.</p>
